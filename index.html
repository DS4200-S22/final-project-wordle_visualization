  <h1>Abstract</h1>
      
  <p>
    <i>Wordle</i> is a popular daily word-guessing game that has become a viral sensation for its simple premise of guessing a five letter word in six attempts. Despite its solo-style play, it has fostered a competitive community. The game provides individual scores but lacks overall game-wide statistics, so trends like overall performance and relative difficulty are not available. Our project aims to make these analyses possible in a visualization that not only captures data about the players, but also the game itself.<br>
    <strong>Keywords:</strong> Linguistics, word puzzle, player performance.<br>

  <h1>Visualization Explanation</h1>
  
  <p>
    TODO: link presentation slides.
  </p>
  <p>Our final visualization tool contains a line graph showing number of players every day, 
    a word cloud that shows every day’s word, and a temporal bar graph. A user can choose whether 
    or not to form the word cloud based on word rarity or player performance. While the word cloud 
    responds to whatever the user chooses, say rarity, the bar graph also responds by forming to be 
    based on the opposite, in this case performance. Both of these views individually stand with a 
    basic tooltip that allows the user to see details upon hovering. However, these two views are 
    also linked, such that the user can hover over any part and see its corresponding bar metric or 
    word in the other view. There is a dynamic legend that also aids to discern what the different 
    channels mean, and additionally, when the user hovers, an additional blub appears above with 
    more details about that days’ statistics. Wrapping this entire thing is a brushing capability 
    in the line graph where highlighting a certain area narrows the focus of all of the other views, correspondingly.   </p>
