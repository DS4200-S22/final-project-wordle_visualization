    <h1>Abstract</h1>
        
    <p>
      <i>Wordle</i> is a popular daily word-guessing game that has become a viral sensation for its simple premise of guessing a five letter word in six attempts. Despite its solo-style play, it has fostered a competitive community. The game provides individual scores but lacks overall game-wide statistics, so trends like overall performance and relative difficulty are not available. Our project aims to make these analyses possible in a visualization that not only captures data about the players, but also the game itself.<br>
      <strong>Keywords:</strong> Linguistics, word puzzle, player performance.<br>

  <h1>Visualization Explanation</h1>
  
  <p>
    TODO: link presentation slides.
  </p>
  <p>Our final visualization tool contains a word cloud, a temporal bar graph including daily breakdowns of what proportion of people won in each level, and the ability to specify a range of dates to model. A user can choose what the word cloud and bar graph will each model, between word rarity and performance. The word cloud would model the words by size based on the specified metric, such as by rarity, but doubly model the other metric by the secondary channel, the color scale. Likewise for the bar graph, the height of the bar being the most prominent part of a bar graph would model the specified metric, such as performance, but doubly model the other metric by its secondary channel, the color scale. The bar graph shows information about the word there, such as part of speech, average number of tries, etc. Each bar is also broken down into the distribution for the number of tries. The number of bars and words shown depends on the date range. The user can choose the range of time to display for the visualization. There is also the ability to hover, which highlights the word in the word map, and also highlights the word on the graph. If the mouse were to hover over the graph, they would also both highlight.
