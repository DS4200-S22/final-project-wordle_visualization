00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Hi everyone! Welcome to Wordle Wonders. 
A visualization about Wordle users on Twitter.

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:012.000
As you’ll see here, this is our visualization

3
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and at the top we have a line graph that shows
the number of players with respect to each day. 

4
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
This line graph is brushable and it uses points
and lines for the marks as well as height for the channels.

5
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
If we scroll down, we will see our two main 
encodings which are a word cloud and a bar graph.

6
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
We chose a word cloud to pay homage to the Wordle 
game and a bar graph to display trends over time.

7
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:45.000
On the left, you’ll see a toggle which shows what 
the word cloud is currently displaying. 

8
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And so, when you click rarity, the larger words 
are the ones that are more frequent. 

9
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.000
So “other” is a very frequent word. And the bar graph 
shows the average number of attempts for each day.

10
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:06.000
When you click the performance toggle, the word cloud 
shows the average number of attempts with respect to size, 

11
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and the bar graph shows the relative 
word frequency with respect to time. 

12
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:20.000
If I hover over “swill” you’ll see its linked on the bar graph, 
and this is a word that has a very high number of guesses because it’s quite large, 

13
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
and if you see the respective bar, 
it has a very low relative word frequency. 

14
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:35.000
And on the top right, you’ll see a little annotation window, 
describing a few statistics about the word you are currently hovering over,

15
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
such as the part of speech as well as the definition.

16
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
And what’s great about this visualization is that it allows you 
to find different correlations about certain statistics 

17
00:01:46.000 --> 00:1:51.000
about Wordle, and it allows you to learn more about the game! Thank you!
